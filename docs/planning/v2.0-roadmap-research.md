# mcp-audit v2.0 Roadmap Research Report

**Date**: December 14, 2025
**Purpose**: Research findings to inform v1.x → v2.0 roadmap planning

---

## Executive Summary

MCP has experienced explosive growth in 2025, becoming the de facto standard for AI-to-tool connectivity. The December 2025 donation to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) marks a pivotal moment—MCP is now vendor-neutral infrastructure co-governed by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Block. This creates both opportunities (standardization, broader adoption) and requirements (tracking AAIF governance, supporting new platforms like goose) for mcp-audit's v2.0 roadmap.

---

## 1. MCP Development Trends & Issues (December 2025)

### Adoption Statistics
- **10,000-16,000+** active public MCP servers deployed
- **28%** of Fortune 500 companies using MCP (up from 12% in 2024)
- **97M+** monthly SDK downloads (Python + TypeScript combined)
- **Major adopters**: ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, VS Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot

### Critical Issues & Blockers

#### A. Security (Top Concern)
The joke "The S in MCP stands for security" reflects real vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability | Description | Severity |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Tool Poisoning** | Malicious instructions embedded in tool descriptions | Critical |
| **Prompt Injection** | Exploiting MCP to inject malicious prompts | Critical |
| **Cross-Server Shadowing** | Malicious server intercepts calls to trusted servers | High |
| **Credential Exposure** | 88% require credentials; 53% use insecure long-lived tokens | High |
| **Context Bleeding** | Sensitive data leaking between MCP sessions | Medium |

**Security tooling emerging**:
- **MCP-scan** (Invariant Labs) - Static/dynamic security scanning
- **Toxic Flow Analysis** (Snyk) - Data flow vulnerability mapping
- **MCP Gateways** (Cloudflare, TrueFoundry) - Centralized governance
- **MCPTox, MindGuard** - Real-time anomaly detection

#### B. Enterprise Readiness Gaps
- Authentication/authorization complexity (OAuth 2.1 added March 2025)
- Governance and observability immature
- No standardized audit trails
- Difficulty evaluating MCP server security before deployment

#### C. Spec Evolution (Key 2025 Updates)
| Version | Date | Key Additions |
|---------|------|---------------|
| November 2025 | Nov 25 | Async operations, statelessness, server identity, Tasks capability, Client ID Metadata Documents |
| June 2025 | Jun 18 | OAuth Resource Server classification, security best practices, elicitation |
| March 2025 | Mar 26 | Streamable HTTP transport, OAuth 2.1 authorization framework |

### Implications for mcp-audit v2.0
1. **Security analysis features** are a major opportunity (gap in ecosystem)
2. **Enterprise governance** features align with market need
3. **Spec tracking** - need to support async operations, Tasks, statelessness
4. **Remote MCP servers** - now dominant deployment model (vs local stdio)

## 2. AAIF: Anthropic Donating MCP to Linux Foundation

### What Happened (December 9, 2025)
- MCP donated to the **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)**
- AAIF is a directed fund under the Linux Foundation
- Modeled after successful foundations (Linux Kernel, Kubernetes, PyTorch)

### Governance Structure
| Role | Organizations |
|------|---------------|
| **Co-Founders** | Anthropic, Block, OpenAI |
| **Supporters** | Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare, Bloomberg |
| **Governance** | Community-driven, vendor-neutral |

### AAIF Founding Projects

| **goose** | Block | Open source AI agent runtime | 24.3k GitHub stars |
| **AGENTS.md** | OpenAI | Project-specific agent instructions | 60,000+ repos |

### goose Details
- **Language**: Rust (59.4%) + TypeScript (33%)
- **Features**: MCP-native, multi-LLM support, autonomous task execution
- **Version**: v1.16.1 (active development)
- **Significance**: First AAIF runtime—reference implementation for agent execution

### AGENTS.md Details
- **Format**: Markdown file alongside README.md
- **Purpose**: Standardized project context for AI coding agents

- **Significance**: De facto standard for agent project configuration

### Implications for mcp-audit v2.0
1. **goose support** - High priority (AAIF reference runtime, MCP-native)
2. **AGENTS.md parsing** - Understand project context for better analysis
3. **AAIF spec tracking** - Governance decisions will affect MCP evolution
4. **Vendor neutrality** - mcp-audit's multi-platform approach aligns with AAIF mission
5. **Community contribution** - Consider contributing mcp-audit analysis to AAIF

## 8. Implementation Considerations

### goose Adapter Challenges
- Rust-based logs (different from Python JSON)
- MCP-native but session format may differ
- Desktop app + CLI modes

### Cursor Adapter Challenges
- Proprietary session format (reverse engineering required)
- Logs location: `~/.cursor/logs/` or similar
- May require community collaboration

### Security Feature Approach
1. **v1.5**: Research phase - evaluate MCP-scan, MCPTox, custom options
2. **v1.8**: Implementation based on research findings
3. Likely hybrid: integrate proven tooling + custom security smells

### AAIF Monitoring
- Track AAIF governance decisions at https://agenticaifoundation.org
- Watch MCP spec updates (especially security, Tasks, statelessness)
- Monitor goose development for session format changes
- Consider formal engagement after v2.0 based on adoption

## 9. Follow-up Tasks

After this research session:
1. ✅ Update `ROADMAP.md` with v1.1 → v2.0 vision section
2. ✅ Create backlog tasks for v1.2 platform expansion research
3. Delete stale hookify hooks (user requested)
4. Continue v0.9.0 integration testing (in progress)
